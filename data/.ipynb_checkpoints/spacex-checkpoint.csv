- Please constrain the launch party to this thread alone. We will remove low effort comments elsewhere!
- Real-time chat on our official Internet Relay Chat (IRC) [#SpaceX on Snoonet](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/?nick=SpaceX_guest%7C?#SpaceX)

r/SpaceX Starlink-12 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread,1600279395,"[](/# MC // section intro)
# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink-12 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

Shalom!
I'm u/Shahar603, your host of the 12th Starlink V1.0 launch.

The 12th operational batch of Starlink satellites (13th overall) will lift off from LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center, Florida on a Falcon 9 rocket. In the weeks following deployment the Starlink satellites will use onboard ion thrusters to reach their operational altitude of 550 km. This is the fourth batch of Starlink satellites which all feature ""visors"" intended to reduce their visibility from Earth. Falcon 9's first stage (B1058.3, the has been used on the *historic* DM-2 mission) will attempt to land on a drone ship approximately 633 km downrange, its third landing overall, and a ships is in place to attempt the recovery of both payload fairing halves.

What technologies and systems does Spacex need to work on over the next 4 years besides Starship to achieve its mars goals?,1600071493,"I wrote a post a few months ago (What will it take for Spacex to send humans to mars in 2024?) which did rather well. However I focused only on Starship itself, not on any of the other pieces that are just as important to achieve Spacex‚Äôs mars-sized ambitions, so let‚Äôs take a look at everything but the big shiny rocket. To be clear (like before), this is less me predicting the future and more me looking to start a discussion based on the data we have and a whole bunch of assumptions, speculations and wishes.

Let's start off by making the mother of all Big Falcon assumptions:

**Starship works as intended**

This is a MASSIVE leap of faith to take. While SN5‚Äôs (and now SN6‚Äôs) flight(s) did alleviate some concerns regarding Starship‚Äôs ascent, and Superheavy doesn‚Äôt really worry me with all the falcon 9 first stages Spacex has to draw experience from, there‚Äôs no guarantee that Spacex‚Äôs re-entry, descent and landing systems will work as well as they want and expect them to, since those all fall somewhere between unusual and revolutionary. Nor is the rapid and reliable reuse guaranteed to work as well as we all want it to. 

Although I will say people need to cool it with claiming Starship is years and years away from orbit; the raptor works and the tanks, plumbing and command &amp; control system are up to standards, as SN5&amp;6 showed. If Spacex wanted to (and had enough engines) they could bolt together a Superheavy booster, stick a Starship on it and fly both expendable to put 100-200 tons in orbit right now if they had a launch pad and a humongous crane. Big waste of money and engines but they could do it. Once Superheavy hops (successfully) you can seriously argue that Starship is closer to reaching orbit than SLS, despite the latter‚Äôs development being started a decade earlier. It‚Äôs just that reaching orbit isn‚Äôt Starships main goal; getting to orbit and back down cheaply and reliably is, which is another thing entirely. To me, SN8‚Äôs 20 km flight will be the big thing to watch: if that works, Starship is ready for orbit. If not, Spacex has a nasty problem or two to solve. For the record, I will say that I think the launch, ascent and descent of SN8 will go fine, but that the flip-down has a high chance of going very, very wrong the first few times. 

Just to reiterate: this is not me saying what will happen, this is me speculating what Elon plans/wants to make happen in order to put humans on the red planet basically 4 years from now, to give people something to ponder on and give their own take. Personally I doubt that humans will really depart for mars in 2024, but given Elon‚Äôs repeated statements that 2024 is still the goal, and the fact that at least at tesla his timelines are getting a little more accurate recently, I have crammed the insane amount of progress needed into the next 3-4 years to make it fit. My timeline should not be taken as a prediction but as my best guess to somehow get all the needed pieces into place given the insane objectives.

So, if we make the admittedly stomach-churning assumption that Starship works and is flying reliably and reusable sometime (early) next year, what else should SpaceX be working on? To me, it seems they need four other pieces to realize their mars ambitions:

**getting Starship to mars -&gt; orbital refueling**

**getting Starship back from mars -&gt; fuel production on mars**

**getting the humans inside Starship to mars -&gt; life support in space**

**keeping the humans inside Starship alive on the surface of mars -&gt; life support on mars**

I will go through them in order from what I consider to be least to most difficult (no part is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù if you ask me):

**Orbital refueling:**

This one I‚Äôve made a U-turn on. I used to think it was a major obstacle but recently have concluded that it won‚Äôt slow down Spacex at all. Why? Because in their Artemis bid, Spacex announced that they plan to use not just tankers, but fuel depots. This simplifies the whole operation massively. Spacex can launch a few custom Starships that consist of nothing but a giant empty fuel tank, something which they can probably build today. No heat shield, no fins, no payload bay, no life support, to maximize the fuel capacity. Only some batteries, a solar panel, rcs and a way to dock. Heck with the recent raptor improvements they might be able to stretch this type of Starship to have even more internal volume for fuel. 

Now these most likely will have to be painted pitch black to prevent an angry mob of astronomers marching on boca chica with pitchforks, but that‚Äôs probably not a bad idea regardless. The fuel boil off in LEO will be a lot less than Starship will have to deal with on its way to mars due to a noticeable lack of shade during the transfer, so subjecting the LEO fuelers to as high a temperature as possible seems like a useful safety margin when designing for that. 

The current Starship can hold 1200 tons of propellant with a large amount of its volume turned over for cargo. Given that a Superheavy can hold 3300 tons of propellant, let‚Äôs say that a fuel depot Starship can hold between 2000 and 3000 tons depending on how much it‚Äôs stretched, with the lower estimate being more likely. Edit: elon recently stated that they are pushing for Starship being able to hold up to 2000 tons of fuel, supporting my hunch that Starship‚Äôs length will increase.

Some back-of-the-envelope calculations show that a 250 ton Starship (100 ton dry mass, 150 ton payload) with 750 tons of fuel and an isp of 380 will have just over 5 km/s of delta V. Going from earth to mars using a hohmann transfer takes just over 4 km/s, while a much faster 3-month transfer takes around 4.8 km/s. This fits well with Elon‚Äôs step-by-step strategy. For the first flights having an extra 1000 m/s will most likely be invaluable, allowing on-route course corrections, meaningful maneuvers in martian orbit, as well as an easier landing, both due to being able to start the landing burn higher up and the fact that more fuel means more mass at the bottom of the Starship making it more stable during the flip and upon touching down. Later flights, after Spacex has a high enough confidence in their navigation, aerodynamic controls and landing system, can then start to burn more fuel to incrementally shorten that transfer time until they reach Elon‚Äôs goal of a three month transfer for humans.

Now what would this mean? If Spacex launches say three of these fuel depot Starships early next year (and they totally will have the means to build and launch these by then, all they need is a working Superheavy), they now have something to use their insane launch cadence for that is both useful and dirt-cheap. Each one of these fully fueled will provide the propellant for three mars-bound or two lunar-surface-bound Starships to reach their destinations. 

Since the tankers will be able to carry between 100 and 150 tons to LEO depending on how far along the vacuum raptor engine is, this is 60 to 90 flights right here for Starship. If I‚Äôm Elon/SpaceX, all I‚Äôm doing in 2021 is flying Starship tankers DOZENS of times to bring fuel up to these depots for use in 2022. Now I know people are excited about a Starship launch putting 400 Starlink satellites into orbit in one go, but let‚Äôs remember that those still cost $300.000 a piece to make, and that‚Äôs after achieving an impressive economy of scale (120 a month). One failure on ascent and there goes over a hundred million dollars. At least for the first dozen launches, Spacex would be wise to start with fuel only imho, and move to include Starlink launches after a few months of successful fuel flights. It will give Starship a simple cheap payload to fly over and over again with minimal impact if it suffers a catastrophic failure on ascent. Simply learn and move on; nothing of significant value was lost. 

While the engineers focus on decreasing the turn-around time and fixing whatever unexpected problems arise due to Starships re-entering multiple times (which there definitely will be, don‚Äôt tell yourself otherwise), the designers can spend 2021 seriously working on life support and ISRU systems, with both available to support the other should they need to. As an additional bonus, all these launches will greatly boost the confidence in Starship from both nasa and the commercial sector, paving the way for Starship‚Äôs utter domination of the commercial launch market from 2022 onward. Finally, maybe the realization that voting for Artemis meant voting for orbital fuel depots will give Shelby a well-earned heart attack (one can dream). /s

If Spacex can get 10 to 20 Starship tankers to orbit in 2021 (they can all be the same ship, they can be 3 different ships or they can be 10 different ships depending on how successful they are in their re-use objectives by then), it will give them a much easier time in 2022; ‚Äúsimply‚Äù fly the mars-bound or moon-bound Starship to LEO, dock with the depot and perform a single large fuel transfer. This way Spacex won‚Äôt have to worry about keeping a dozen Starship tankers in orbit at a time.

As for orbital refueling itself (wow, went a little bit of topic there), I don't see any major hurdles: if Starship‚Äôs fuel lines can handle the pressures of being fueled on the pad through the Superheavy booster as is currently the plan, than all Spacex needs to do is not exceed those pressures during on-orbit fuel transfers, which really should not be hard so long as they take their time with them.

**Life support on mars**

This might surprise some, but I actually think keeping humans alive on the martian surface will be much easier than keeping them alive in space due to the zero-g and radiation concerns that the latter will have to deal with. Consequently, if I were to suggest only one thing to Spacex from my very comfortable armchair, it would be to split the two: one type of Starship designed to act as a permanently inhabitable martian base that is basically an office tower with a big empty drained fuel tank and some engines at the bottom, and one designed for crewed use in zero-g as well as ascent and descent on both mars and earth. Trying to make a Starship do both is asking for trouble if you ask me, as well as greatly complicating the design (‚Äúthe best part is no part‚Äù). Yes this would mean that these ‚Äúbase‚Äù Starships will not return to earth, but that is not that big a loss given the production rates Spacex is already achieving, plus having a few extra raptors on mars that can be cannibalised for parts or simply swapped with a malfunctioning raptor of another Starship sounds to me like good redundancy. Furthermore this split would have three enormous upsides:

1: The base ones are easier to design and build due to only being operated and inhabited under gravity after landing. 

Let‚Äôs remind ourselves that if Spacex wants to send people to mars in 2024, it will be much easier to find support from nasa and the like if there already is a habitable structure waiting on the martian surface for them, which will have to be sent there in 2022. The easier base ones can be the focus of design in 2021 before being built and launched in 2022. Meanwhile the manned zero-g Starship will be granted another year to prove itself as now it won‚Äôt be needed until 2023, which is probably a good thing anyway. Even if Spacex can build these next year there is no guarantee that any agency would have enough confidence in Starship by then to provide them with astronauts. Taking another year to really prove Starship‚Äôs reliability as a launch and landing system might be enough (remember this means dozens of launches since we‚Äôre assuming Starship works) for a Starship to take on crew in LEO at the end of 2022/early 2023, probably at first using a dragon capsule to go to and from orbit as Tim Dodd and others have suggested.

2: It‚Äôs simply much safer.

Living and working in a separate Starship from the one that you land and launch in will probably be a whole lot more comfortable for the crew on mars. Sleeping well might be a bit harder if every morning the giant fuel tank a few dozen meters below you is a little bit fuller with highly combustible propellant than the day before. Compared to if the tank beneath you is completely drained while the Starship you will return in sits a few miles away being steadily refueled with you only returning to it a few hours/days before launch. Good back-up in terms of life support systems too; if something is really vitally needed you can take it with you from the lander/launcher upon arrival or from the base/habitat upon leaving, as only one at a time will be housing crew. I‚Äôm sure nasa would be much more comfortable with this system too.

3: This base/habitat Starship would be perfect for nasa‚Äôs Artemis program:

While I don‚Äôt agree with Zubrin on a lot of things (seriously, he needs to stop with the whole mini-starship idea, it‚Äôs not gonna happen), he is right when he says that starship as a lunar ascent vehicle makes very little sense imo. It would be a huge investment of fuel and time for no real gain besides funding and nasa support, the latter of which is all but assured if Starship works. If instead Spacex offered Starship as a lunar base and suggested that nasa use the landers from the other two companies to go to and from the lunar surface, there‚Äôs no way nasa would say no. Imagine the offer: 

‚ÄúSo here‚Äôs the deal: we will build a Starship interior to your specifications and wishes. Once built we will launch it, refuel it in orbit and fly it out to whatever lunar crater you want us to. Once landed, we fill drain every drop of fuel out of the tanks, lower the staircase/elevator and wait for your crew to arrive on one of those landers. It will have a thousand cubic meters of interior volume, aka more than the ISS, and you can have it on the moon in 2023 since we want to send one or two to mars in 2022 anyway. We‚Äôd like you to give us a billion dollars and a promise for martian astronauts in 2024 once we‚Äôve landed it in exchange. Deal?‚Äù. Obviously Spacex won‚Äôt be that blunt, but I don‚Äôt believe that nasa wouldn‚Äôt fall over themselves to take an offer like that. 

So what would this designed-for-gravity Starship need? Honestly, nothing fancy, which is why I suggested splitting them. Starship will have the unique luxury to simply, as musk has stated, throw mass at a problem until it is solved. As an example, let us say that a mars crew would number an impressive 12 people (one mission commander/test pilot, 4 scientists, 3 engineers, 2 botanists and 2 doctors). We know that they will be staying on mars for at least two years, but for safety let‚Äôs design it for 4 years. If they all eat like the most wasteful people on earth (cough, americans, cough...) they will consume 10 tons of food per year, with half of that being the recommended healthy amount. So.... let‚Äôs just put 40 tons of food on board. Done. 4 to 8 years of food just like that.  

This is what using mass as a solution looks like. All Spacex needs is a way to store and preserve that food by either drying or freezing it for up to 5+ years, at which point that problem is solved. I‚Äôm no food expert but surely that technology exists?

Same story with water. 12 people will drink less than 10 tons of water a year, but here recycling is a well-understood and ‚Äúeasy‚Äù thing to implement. We‚Äôre able to reach 90+% efficiency on the ISS I think (if I‚Äôm wrong feel free to correct me), so if Spacex gets anywhere close to that (anything over 50% will do) they can put 20 or 30 tons of water on board Starship and for all intents and purposes have an unlimited supply. Recycling CO2 back into O2 is a solved problem that basically only requires power which Starship will have plenty of.

Also keep in mind that the above figures don‚Äôt assume food production or recycling, higher efficiency or using martian resources like water ice, any one of which would make surviving on mars for a few years a non-issue.

So‚Ä¶ is that it? Well... yeah, pretty much. Spacex will need to design some ways to control temperature, humidity and (human) waste disposal as well as provide communication and spacesuits for the astronauts, but these are by no means show stoppers, especially with help from nasa and all the lessons learned from dragon. As for spare parts they can either take a 3D-printer or simply a literal ton worth of the more important components, or both if they want to. 

None of the above is easy, but none of it is something that Spacex cannot obtain or build in a year (that year being 2021).

I have a design in my head for how this thing would look like on the inside but I‚Äôm a pretty bad programmer/modeller. If someone who is good at that wants to model and render it and read my far too detailed description feel free to ask. Just be prepared for a very long response comment.

**Life support in space**

This is where things start to get ‚Äúactually‚Äù difficult even if Starship works. Keeping astronauts alive during the 6+ month trip to mars will be easy. Keeping them healthy and in good condition will be very hard. Like I said with the mars base Starship, food, water and air won‚Äôt be a problem. Even basic water recycling and CO2 scrubbers will keep the crew alive just fine. Put 10 tons of food and 10 tons of water on board and there‚Äôs your problem solved. Even if they have to abort the martian landing on-route for some reason and slingshot back to earth they will be fine as they will have 1 to 2 years or more of food, water and air. No, the two big problems will be radiation and weightlessness. On mars neither of these factors are a show stopper: The gravity most likely will be fine and mars and its atmosphere will shield you from some/much of the cosmic rays, while putting the radiation shelter right below your 40 tons of food with your 20-30 tons of water surrounding it will protect you reasonably well from solar storms. None of these ‚Äúeasy fixes‚Äù is available in interplanetary space, as there is no planet to create gravity or block radiation (shocking I know), nor will these ones be as full of food and water to use as shielding since they will be carrying much more cargo and scientific instruments. No reason not to if there is already a base Starship full of food and water waiting on mars. 

The simplest way to solve the radiation problem is some sort of physical shielding material in the walls (maybe hydrogen-rich foam?) and a solar storm shelter which is surrounded by all of the food and water on board. Whatever Spacex comes up with, this is something that I hope they work very closely with nasa on. The main problem is that they will not have much time to test this theoretical solution with humans on board until probably 2023. At the earliest Starship will be flying with crew on board in 2022, and even that‚Äôs jaw-droppingly aggressive. It would probably require Starship to reach falcon 9‚Äôs current amount of launches (a 100 basically) in less than two years (aka, one orbital launch every week on average) with little to no failures before nasa would trust Starship to launch and land safely, since I don‚Äôt see any sign of Spacex adding a launch abort system or changing the landing sequence. For the first few flights they can use a dragon to shuttle between a Starship in LEO and earth‚Äôs surface, but they can only do that a few times before the costs in both money and disposed falcon 9 second stages start adding up. No humans have ever gone beyond the earth-moon system, and no human has gone beyond earth‚Äôs magnetic shield since 1972, so this part very much has a possibility of providing some unwelcome unknown unknowns. 

There is another big thing though that I think too many people ignore: weightlessness. The first flights to mars will take at least 6 months. Even with exercise, I think it‚Äôs fair to say that astronauts currently do not have the muscle and bone strength to stand up and walk by themselves after returning from a 6 month mission on the ISS without help. Mars‚Äô lower gravity might help them recuperate faster, but this too is a complete unknown that neither nasa nor Spacex will or should count on imho. So far I‚Äôve seen only two solutions suggested: lots of exercise on-route combined with simply letting the crew recover slowly once they land on mars, or tethering two starships together and spinning them. I don‚Äôt think either one will be an option. The first one is probably not enough, and the second one is too risky. Nasa would almost certainly go pale with that amount of inhabited mass under constant loads and stresses from circular acceleration, even if Spacex can make it work mechanically. 

The only alternative I can come up with is this (and since I don‚Äôt believe for a second that I‚Äôm smarter than the teams at Spacex I‚Äôd very much appreciate someone more knowledgeable to explain to me where my thinking is flawed): You place a ring inside the pressurised part of Starship 8 meters in diameter and 3 meters in height, connected to a central pole that is bolted to the floors above and below but is free to spin. You put the sleeping accommodations on the inside of this ring with your head facing towards the centre. At the start of the sleeping shift, you spin the ring up to a lateral speed where you feel your back being pushed into the wall at a force of one g. Since your entire body is experiencing the same acceleration at every part, as the radius between your head and the pole and your feet and the pole is constant, it shouldn‚Äôt be nauseating. If there are walls on all sides of you (and one door) so that you don‚Äôt see the rotation, and your ‚Äúbed‚Äù is slanted slightly to account for the coriolis effect, would it not feel just like regular gravity? Big bonus: you can start at one g and slowly move to 0.38 g over the course of several months to acclimate to mars. Small bonus: if you‚Äôre willing to pay the power cost, putting some big scoops or buckets on the outside of this ring might help with circulating the air around the ship since it will be spinning quite fast. Finally you could also spin it faster to do exercises like push-ups (basically any effort where your body remains more or less fixed to the floor could work), meaning you could compensate for being in zero g most of the day by sleeping under gravity and performing some exercises while under higher gravity \[insert goku joke here\].

I‚Äôm sure I have overlooked something, but it seems to me like this would work and be a reasonably effective and practical solution. Feel free to explain to me why I‚Äôm wrong.

In short, Spacex needs to find a solution to the zero-g and radiation problems by the end of 2022 at the latest. Firstly because dearmoon is scheduled for 2023 and I can‚Äôt see nasa (much less the US congress) stomach letting private civilians being the first humans to return to the moon‚Äôs vicinity since Apollo instead of nasa astronauts. If a Starship capable of sustaining humans is flying successfully in 2022 and dearmoon is set for mid-to-late 2023, I‚Äôd bet on there being effectively an order from congress for Spacex and nasa to fly american astronauts on Starship around the moon before dearmoon takes place, regardless of the state of either SLS or Artemis. And before you say that that would be massive hypocrisy, remember that these are US politicians we‚Äôre talking about. 

Secondly because they really need to perform a 6 month trial run at the L2 earth-moon lagrange point to confirm that their life support, radiation protection and zero-g mitigation solutions work as intended. (This is why my money is still on humans to mars in 2026 because I can‚Äôt make myself believe that everything will work right the first time they try it). If they want to send people to mars in 2024 they will need to have this test done to satisfy nasa (or whomever is providing them with astronauts) by the end of 2023.

So my reasoning/guess is that Spacex will want the design of this version of Starship finished in early 2022, build and launch one that summer, and maybe bring some crew on board with a dragon to prove out its life support systems by the end of the year. The big year for this piece of the puzzle will be 2023, as this is the Starship type that they will most likely use for dearmoon as well as perform any major test runs in the earth-moon system, before the big launch of the first crew to mars in 2024.

**Refueling starships on mars**

So why do I think this is the biggest hurdle? Isn‚Äôt the sabatier process a well-understood and quite simple chemical reaction? Yes it is, and the problem as I see it isn‚Äôt with the chemistry, but with the scale, the schedule and the industrial processes that are needed. 

Spacex will have to design, test and build a full-on fuel production system‚Ä¶ and have it ready for launch roughly 18 months from now. Why so soon? Because there is no way, repeat NO WAY that Spacex will be allowed to send astronauts to mars, on a rocket that cannot get back to earth without being refueled, if there is no fuel production on mars at the time of launch. I know Elon has often said that there is a real chance that the first crew sent to mars will die, but I can‚Äôt imagine he actually believes that he can get professional astronauts and nasa support if he doesn‚Äôt take every precaution possible to ensure that they can get back home safely. 

Just to be clear: I don‚Äôt mean that there needs to be a fully fuelled Starship sitting on mars when the first crew lands, but there absolutely, 100% needs to be a Starship on mars producing fuel by the time the first crew leaves earth. And this is not as easy to pull off as it might seem.

Getting the CO2 is a non-issue: mars‚Äô atmosphere is so rich with it that you might not even need to filter the incoming air. Also as long as the crane/elevator on Starship works, setting up a large solar field won‚Äôt be that difficult provided Spacex has made the panels reasonably easy to unload and deploy (safe assumption if you ask me), and if the surrounding surface is flat. Given that Spacex has chosen a landing/base site in the northern plains (IIRC) this should also not give any major problems.

The main difficulty will be getting enough water to produce enough fuel. If Elon is serious with his recent comment about ‚Äú\~2 tons/day‚Äù of fuel, which I have to assume he is, that means many tons of water ice have to be excavated, moved, filtered of other materials, melted and separated into H2 and O2, **per day**, for over two years, with no one around to fix something if it breaks. This is orders of magnitude more intense than what we‚Äôve done on mars before. To be blunt, we are talking nothing less than autonomous bulldozers, that weigh several tons and make Perseverance look like a toy. Scooping up and gathering a truckload of ice and rocks daily and dumping them into whatever device Spacex comes up with to separate out the ice, melt it and split it into hydrogen and oxygen (of which the former probably must be combined with CO2 and turned into methane immediately given its habit of not liking being stored and subsequently floating away), and not break down thanks to the martian dust getting anywhere crucial. 

Even setting aside the fact that this operation will make the planetary protection crowd pull their hair out, the chances of it working as designed the first time are not high if you ask me. There is every chance that something wears out faster than expected, stops working due to some unknown unknown, or gets wrecked by a malfunctioning autonomous vehicle glitching out and driving into/over it. Once there are actual humans on mars, keeping these machines operational won‚Äôt be all that hard, but basic safety standards (and nasa) are going to require that the fuel farm works reliably on its own, for as long as it takes to make enough propellant for the first crew to return home safely in case of an emergency, before the go-ahead is given for that first crewed mars mission to leave earth. 

I would not be shocked if Spacex manages to design, test and build a system that they think will work in 2021 and launch, refuel, transfer to and land it on mars in 2022, only to find out that some crucial part doesn‚Äôt work as designed under the martian conditions, leaving a fully habitable base Starship and an empty propellant plant Starship sitting on mars with all the accompanying parts needed to start a base (pressurised cybertruck rover, unpressurised cybertruck rover, water ice gatherer/bulldozer, fuel transporter, solar farm and guidance &amp; landing beacon) present, but no way to make fuel. It will be the most infuriating and cathartic thing ever at the same time. Such a situation will almost certainly set the Spacex timetable back the full two years, as I just can‚Äôt see nasa allowing astronauts to get in a Starship and blasting off to mars if there is no way for them to get back yet. I don‚Äôt think the argument ‚ÄúWell once they are there they can fix the fuel farm instantly!‚Äù will hold much weight, since if something important has broken, what‚Äôs to say that something else will not go wrong unexpectedly that the crew can‚Äôt fix, leaving them stranded? 

My basic reasoning is this: the other three parts can be tested in LEO or on earth with the results being representative of their supposed tasks, but this one cannot. The environment on mars is simply too different from the one on earth (especially the atmosphere), and the scale and ambition of Spacex‚Äôs plan means that the rovers currently on mars are not much of a reference either. There is no way for us to know outside computer models what a five-ton vehicle driving around on mars for years hauling several tons of regolith and ice around daily would go through in terms of wear and tear, creating a massive potential for unknown unknowns to appear where we don‚Äôt expect them. To put Spacex‚Äôs project in perspective: the first fully loaded Starship upon touchdown will probably consist of 99% of all the mass humanity has ever landed on the surface of mars. Let that sink in...

&amp;#x200B;

So that‚Äôs my take on Spacex‚Äôs mars ambitions. If Starship works (big if, but it seems to be getting more believable by the day), I am reasonably confident about orbital refueling and a martian habitat being ready on time, but have reservations about the human-rated Starships and am outright concerned regarding the autonomous propellant plant working as designed. As I‚Äôve mentioned, my money if SN8‚Äôs 20 km flight goes well is on Spacex getting a Starship to mars in 2022, but not sending humans until 2026, either due to the 2022 starships not performing as well as intended (or not performing at all if they crash) or due to Starship not yet being declared safe for human flight in 2024.

Now before I go ahead and request the longest-reddit-thread-of-the-year award (I genuinely think this post is twice as long as my previous one), I‚Äôm curious as to your response to the three questions that in my opinion sum up the whole thing:

1, Did I miss something important besides the four areas I covered?

2, If you agree that these are the major roadblocks for Spacex and Starship, do you agree with my take on them? Did I badly underestimate something that is much harder than I gave it credit for? Or are certain things that I considered difficult much easier than I made them out to be? 

3, Regardless of whether or not you agree with my list, ranking and reasoning, what do you think Spacex‚Äôs biggest obstacle will be to sending humans to mars in 2024, assuming Starship itself works?

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink-10 Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

This is the /u/hitura-nobad bringing you live coverage of the Starlink V1.0-L11 launch.
## Mission Overview

The 11th operational batch of Starlink satellites (12th overall) will lift off from LC-39A at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida on a Falcon 9 rocket. In the weeks following deployment the Starlink satellites will use onboard ion thrusters to reach their operational altitude of 550 km. This is the third batch of Starlink satellites which all feature ""visors"" intended to reduce their visibility from Earth. Falcon 9's first stage will attempt to land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange, its sixth landing overall, and a ships is in place to attempt the recovery of both payload fairing halves.

# Starship Serial Number 6 - 150 Meter Hop Test

Starship SN6, equipped with a single Raptor engine (SN27), will attempt a hop at SpaceX's development and launch site at Boca Chica, Texas. The test article will rise to a maximum altitude of about 150 meters and translate a similar distance downrange to the landing pad. The flight should last approximately one minute and follow a trajectory very similar to [Starhopper's 150 meter hop](https://youtu.be/bYb3bfA6_sQ) in August of 2019. The Raptor engine is offset slightly from the vehicle's vertical axis, so some unusual motion is to be expected as SN5 lifts off, reorients the engine beneath the vehicle's center of mass, and lands. SN5 has six legs stowed inside the skirt which will be deployed in flight for landing. The exact launch time may not be known until just a few minutes before launch, and will be preceded by a [local siren](https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=51332.msg2114312#msg2114312) about 10 minutes ahead of time.

## About the payloads

"" The BlackSky Global spacecraft deployed sequentially beginning 1 hour and 1 minute after liftoff, and the Starlink satellites deployed approximately 1 hour and 32 minutes after liftoff. Starlink satellites were deployed in a circular orbit, as was done on the first through fourth Starlink missions. Additionally, all Starlink satellites on this flight are equipped with a deployable visor to block sunlight from hitting the brightest spots of the spacecraft ‚Äì a measure SpaceX has taken as part of our work with leading astronomical groups to [mitigate satellite reflectivity](https://www.spacex.com/updates/starlink-update-04-28-2020/).

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink-9 Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread [Take 2]!

I'm u/hitura-nobad, bringing you live coverage of the Starlink V1.0-L9 launch.
## Mission Overview

The ninth operational batch of Starlink satellites (tenth overall) along with two Earth-observation satellites for BlackSky Global will lift off from LC-39A at the Kennedy Space Center on a Falcon 9 rocket. In the weeks following deployment the Starlink satellites will use onboard ion thrusters to reach their operational altitude of 550 km. This is the first batch of Starlink satellites which all feature ""visors"" intended to reduce their visibility from Earth. Falcon 9's first stage will attempt to land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange, its fifth landing overall, and ships are in place to attempt the recovery of both payload fairing halves.

## Mission Details

#Starship Serial Number 5 - 150 Meter Hop Test

Starship SN5, equipped with a single Raptor engine (SN27), will attempt a hop at SpaceX's development and launch site at Boca Chica, Texas. The test article will rise to a maximum altitude of about 150 meters and translate a similar distance downrange to the landing pad. The flight should last approximately one minute and follow a trajectory very similar to [Starhopper's 150 meter hop](https://youtu.be/bYb3bfA6_sQ) in August of 2019. The Raptor engine is offset slightly from the vehicle's vertical axis, so some unusual motion is to be expected as SN5 lifts off, reorients the engine beneath the vehicle's center of mass, and lands. SN5 has six legs stowed inside the skirt which will be deployed in flight for landing. The exact launch time may not be known until just a few minutes before launch, and will be preceded by a [local siren](https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=51332.msg2114312#msg2114312) about 10 minutes ahead of time.

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX ANASIS-II Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/Shahar603, your launch host for this mission[.](https://airbus-h.assetsadobe2.com/is/image/content/dam/products-and-solutions/space/telecommunication/eurostar/ANASIS-II_shipment_Copyright_Airbus.jpg?wid=1920&amp;fit=fit,1&amp;qlt=85,0)

## Overview

ANASIS-II is a South Korean military communications satellite, built by Airbus Defense and Space and operated by South Korea's Agency for Defense Development. Based on the Eurostar-3000 platform the satellite will operate in geostationary orbit and provide wide coverage over the Korean Peninsula. A Falcon 9 rocket will deliver the spacecraft to a geostationary transfer orbit and the booster will land on a drone ship downrange.

Per the customer's request, live coverage will end shortly after first stage landing.

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX GPS III SV03 (Columbus) Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

Hello everybody, I am u/Marc020202, and it has been a while since I hosted the last thread!

**Mission Overview** 

This mission launches the third GPS III satellite into orbit and is the second GPS launch for SpaceX. Although the GPS III SV01 launch aboard Falcon 9 expended the booster, this mission's booster will be recovered via ASDS landing. The destination orbit, however, is unchanged. SpaceX is also planning to launch at least 3 further GPS III missions.

# Primary Mission: Deployment of payload into the correct orbit

Since the press kit for this Mission has not been released yet, it is not 100% clear how the mission will be executed, however, it is likely that like the GPS SV1 mission back in 2018 the Second stage will target a parking orbit first, before Igniting the Merlin Vacuum engine again, boosting the satellite into a 20200km by 1200km Orbit with an inclination of 55¬∞. The first stage engine burn will likely be a bit shorter to save fuel to allow B1060 to reenter and land.

Check recent comments for real time updates.

At the start of thread #12 Starship SN5 has just moved to the launch site and is preparing for testing. Starship SN6 consists of a fully stacked propulsion section at the assembly site. Starship test articles are expected to make several suborbital hops in the coming months beginning with a 150 meter hop and progressing toward a 20 km hop. Orbital flight requires the SuperHeavy booster, for which [a new high bay is soon to be erected](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1269418186757206016 'Tweet by @elonmusk'). SpaceX continues to focus heavily on development of its Starship production line in Boca Chica, TX.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starhip development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

How to get to Mars - Dr. Zubrin AMA - Saturday 27th 2:00PM(ET)/18:00(GMT),1592504732,"#[We're pleased to announce, Dr. Robert Zubrin will be returning to r/SpaceX for another AMA next Saturday in conjunction with The Mars Society.](https://i.imgur.com/QBmST0K.png)

While I'm sure that Dr. Zubrin needs no introduction for most of us here, for those of you who are new, [Dr. Zubrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zubrin) is of course the Mars Society President and one of the founders since 1998. Earth's most famous and passionate advocate for Mars, backing that energy with serious engineering knowledge, working on hundreds of space exploration and nuclear tech research papers, including the famous [Mars Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct) mission! He has also authored or co-authored over a dozen books, just last year publishing [The Case for Space](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HDSSKHJ/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0). (My favourite is [The Case for Mars](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Mars-Plan-Settle-Planet/dp/145160811X), but I highly recommend both books.) Not to mention literally hundreds of interviews on the subject (many available on youtube). Zubrin has spent his considerable talents towards figuring out exactly how to get to Mars for decades; With SpaceX being created with nearly the sole purpose of getting humanity to Mars, there is a deep shared purpose, with Dr. Zubrin keenly watching SpaceX from the start with as much interest as any of us, even helping shape Musk's passion for Mars as a destination.

With more than a week until the AMA, I recommend checking out [last year's AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/e0kqpk/im_robert_zubrin_ama_noon_pacific_today/) which was a wealth of information. Of course, any of his books are highly recommended. More recently, there is [this 2 parter interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwdipsDsQYs) directly about SpaceX, Musk and how they change our path to Mars. Recently Zubrin has also penned numerous [articles](https://spacenews.com/op-ed-toward-a-coherent-artemis-plan/) analyzing the lunar [Artemis plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program) which SpaceX has recently become a part of with Dragon XL and Starship HLS contracts in the early stages. Dr. Zubrin also spoke with Musk at Boca Chica as recently as February and wrote about that [here](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/02/mars-elon-musk-plan-to-settle-red-planet/?fbclid=IwAR3HY65gnvLUZQsOdAkksEF4PCF1Aql3VJflaIAugd2C6inFdG8lDdP7RbM). While a week is not enough to read a fraction of Dr. Zubrin's work, I hope most of you will check some of it out prior to the AMA, it is inspiring stuff!

Looking forward to another solid AMA!

#Starlink-9 (STARLINK V1.0-L9)

## Overview

The tenth Starlink launch overall and the ninth operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy 58-60 Starlink satellites into an elliptical orbit roughly 25 minutes into the flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups, making use of precession rates to separate themselves into three planes. This mission includes the second rideshare on a Starlink mission, with [two of BlackSky's satellites on top of the Starlink stack](https://spacenews.com/blacksky-launching-two-satellites-on-june-starlink-mission/). The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 632 km downrange.

1. Skysat is a paying customer. It's well-known that SpaceX's internal costs for launching boosters are likely well-below what they charge commercial customers...but it still does cost them money. By dropping 2 Starlink satellites and making room for a few Skysat ride-shares, they're now lowering their own internal launch costs. I have no idea by how much, Skysat just said they got a ""good deal"", so I'm guessing that's probably somewhere between $1-5 million.

2. No static fire test. While this seems like just an efficiency boost (which it is), it's also a non-zero cost. The have to get their crew onsite, they likely have to pay to get NASA/FAA people onsite, they have to fuel the vehicle, pay for cryogenics, etc. This all seems trivial, and when you have a rocket launching for $150 million it is; but when you have a rocket that can be launched multiple times, decreasing its per-launch price each time it goes up, you have to start looking for financial savings elsewhere.

SpaceX appears to just really aggressively to be looking for any way to (safely) cut cost-per-flight down. This is similar to catching their fairings, which are a rounding-error on expendable launches, but actually do start to add up when you're reusing your rockets.

All this to say, this is why I think SpaceX is so much better positioned to build something like Starlink, and why I really don't think there will ever be other competitors. They already have 500+ satellites in orbit when their next closest competitor just declared bankruptcy, and the next closest after that just issues press-releases about their plans and performs one sub-orbital flight every year. Meanwhile, SpaceX is aggressively getting their launch costs down and putting 100+ satellites in orbit per month.",spacex,hexydes,False,/r/spacex/comments/h8ah79/starlink_the_ocho_launch_seems_to_be_really/

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink 8 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/Shaha603, your host for this mission[.](https://i.redd.it/ck3ipxff9c451.png)

**Mission Overview**

The ninth Starlink launch overall and the eighth operational batch‚Ä† of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy 58 satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of precession rates to separate themselves into three planes. Riding along are 3 SkySat satellites launched for planet labs. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.
Half of Falcon 9‚Äôs fairing previously flew on the JCSAT-18/Kacific1 mission, and the other half previously flew on SpaceX‚Äôs third Starlink mission. 

‚Ä† The first Starlink mission launched a batch of prototype satellites that do not form part of the operational constellation.

FCC just voted to allow Starlink to bid on low latency tier in the $16B rural broadband subsidy auction.,1591767681,"Potentially huge good news for Starlink:

1. FCC will hold an auction in October 29 to award $16B subsidy over 10 years for building up broadband infrastructure for rural America.

2. The auction has two latency tiers high and low, the low latency tier requires latency to be less than 100ms, and vendors in this tier will have a big advantage in auction.

3. SpaceX has been arguing Starlink can meet this latency threshold, but since they (and all the other LEO constellation) are not in commercial service yet, there're proposals to forbid them from bidding on low latency tier at all.

4. Less than a months ago, FCC released a document stating LEO constellation is not allowed to bid on the low latency tier, this would make it difficult for Starlink to get significant amount of subsidy from this program.

5. Today FCC took a vote on whether to go ahead with the auction, it looks like just before the vote they changed their stands on the issue and now allows LEO constellation like Starlink to bid on low latency tier.

6. In order to get the subsidy, Starlink still need to prove its latency to FCC's satisfaction and will need to face off the other broadband providers in the auction, but this could potentially allow Starlink to get significant amount of subsidy (i.e. multiple of billions) from this program, it could be a huge boost for Starlink and Starship in terms of funding.

1. [Chairman Ajit Pai's statement](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/060962555534/DOC-364811A2.pdf):

    &gt; And, at the request of one of my fellow commissioners, **we also don‚Äôt entirely close the door on low earth orbit satellite providers bidding in the low-latency tier.** However, it is also important to keep in mind the following point: The purpose of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is to ensure that Americans have access to broadband, no matter where they live. It is not a technology incubator to fund untested technologies. And we will not allow taxpayer funding to be wasted. A new technology may sound good in theory and look great on paper. But this multi-billion-dollar broadband program will require ‚Äút‚Äùs to be crossed‚Äînot fingers. So any such application will be given very close scrutiny.

2. [Commissioner Michael O'Rielly's statement](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/060962555534/DOC-364811A3.pdf):

    &gt; **I am grateful to the Chairman for agreeing to expand eligibility for the low-latency performance tier and change language that was prejudicial to certain providers.** While a technology neutral policy across the board may have been more effective in promoting innovation and maximizing the value of ratepayer investments, I recognize that a balancing act was necessary to reach the current disposition. I also thank the Chairman for agreeing to clarify that the Commission will re-evaluate the eligibility conditions prior to moving forward with the second phase of the auction. Communications technology evolves at an extremely rapid pace, and who knows which technologies will have advanced or emerged by the time we get to Phase II?

3. [Commissioner Geoffrey Starks's statement](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/060962555534/DOC-364811A6.pdf):

    &gt; The ten-year term the Commission chose in January has additional ramifications for this Public Notice. Committing so much of the budget for so long raises the stakes on how we treat emerging technologies and technical capabilities. **I appreciate Commissioner O‚ÄôRielly‚Äôs work in revising this Public Notice to eliminate the categorical bar on low earth orbit satellite systems bidding in the lowlatency tier, especially now that we have evidence in the record that those systems can meet the 100-millisecond latency standard.** At the same time, I see no need for the Public Notice‚Äôs predictive judgments about the merits of short-form applications from low earth orbit satellite operators. As I have stated previously, **next-generation satellite broadband holds tremendous technological promise for addressing the digital divide and is led by strong American companies with a lengthy record of success.** Commission staff should evaluate those applications on their own merits.

4. Possible reason for FCC's change of mind, [found by u/softwaresaur](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/gzszn0/the_proposal_also_will_allow_low_earth_orbit/ftjjlh8/): [SpaceX held 3 day meeting with FCC on May 27/28/29](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/106012288627473/RDOF%20Ex%20Parte%20(6-1-2020\)%20(REDACTED\).pdf) to present [confidential test data that shows Starlink can indeed meet the low latency criteria](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10529094752788/SpaceX%20RDOF%20Ex%20Parte%20Confidentiality%20Request%20for%20Exhibit%20A%20(5-29-2020\).pdf):

    &gt; ...  on May 27, 28, and 29, 2020, ... SpaceX discussed [with the FCC] the draft Public Notice that would establish procedures for Auction 904. As demonstrated in Exhibit A, SpaceX explained that its system easily clears the Commission‚Äôs 100 ms threshold for low-latency services, even including its ‚Äúprocessing time‚Äù during unrealistic worst-case situations.

    &gt; Exhibit A, which is marked as ‚ÄúConfidential Information,‚Äù concerns SpaceX‚Äôs proprietary network latency testing information and internal performance data. This is company-specific, competitively-sensitive, business confidential and/or proprietary and commercial information concerning SpaceX‚Äôs operations that would not routinely be made available to the public, and has been carefully guarded from competitors. If it were disclosed, SpaceX‚Äôs potential competitors could use it to determine information regarding SpaceX‚Äôs competitive position, operations, and performance, and could use that information to gain a competitive advantage over SpaceX.

5. Some news articles, although they don't get into as much details:

* [FCC awarding up to $16 billion to address U.S. areas lacking broadband service](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-telecom-internet/fcc-awarding-up-to-16-billion-to-address-u-s-areas-lacking-broadband-service-idUSKBN23G29R?utm_source=reddit.com): This is already posted to this subreddit, but it's really vague.

* [FCC Clears Way for SpaceX to Vie for Rural Broadband Subsidies](https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/fcc-clears-way-for-spacex-to-vie-for-rural-broadband-subsidies): A better article that included some quotes from Pai and O‚ÄôRielly

#GPS Block III, Space Vehicle 3 (Columbus)

## Overview

GPS III are the third generation of the U.S. Space Force's NAVSTAR Global Positioning System satellites. The GPS III development contract was awarded to a team led by Lockheed Martin. Block III will improve position, navigation, and timing services for warfighter and civil users yielding superior system security, accuracy and reliability. When fully deployed, the GPS III constellation will feature a cross-linked command and control architecture, allowing the entire GPS constellation to be updated simultaneously from a single ground station. Additionally, a new spot beam capability for enhanced military (M-Code) coverage and increased resistance to hostile jamming will be incorporated. These enhancements will contribute to improved accuracy and assured availability for military and civilian users worldwide.

Lockheed Martin's flight-proven A2100 bus serves as the GPS III spacecraft platform. Unlike the GPS IIF satellite, the GPS III satellite features an apogee propulsion system. The satellite features a LEROS-1C engine as an apogee propulsion system as well as 2 deployable solar arrays to generate power. ITT, Clifton, N.J. provides the navigation payload, and General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Gilbert, Ariz., provides the Network Communications Element (NCE) which includes the UHF Crosslink and Tracking Telemetry &amp; Command (TT&amp;C) subsystems.

This mission launches the third GPS III satellite into orbit, and is the second GPS launch for SpaceX. Although the GPS III SV01 launch aboard Falcon 9 expended the booster, this mission's booster will be recovered via ASDS landing.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather, and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

CCtCap Demonstration Mission 2 Stage 1 Recovery Discussion and Updates Thread,1590954088,"Hello! It is u/RocketLover0119 hosting the recovery thread for core B1058.1 after successfully lofting S2 and Dragon to orbit with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley for the historic DM-2 mission, which returned american astronauts, on an american rocket, from american soil, back into orbit and to the ISS. Below is a table on the ships and their duties and status, as well as updates and resources.

## About DM-2

""On Saturday, May 30 at 3:22 p.m. EDT, SpaceX‚Äôs [Falcon 9](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/) launched [Crew Dragon‚Äôs second demonstration (Demo-2) mission](https://www.spacex.com/static/images/launches/Dem0-2_Artwork.png) from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA‚Äôs Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the next day Crew Dragon autonomously docked to the International Space Station. This test flight with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on board the [Dragon spacecraft](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/dragon/) returned human spaceflight to the United States.

Demo-2 is the final major test for SpaceX‚Äôs human spaceflight system to be certified by NASA for operational crew missions to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX is returning human spaceflight to the United States with one of the safest, most advanced systems ever built, and NASA‚Äôs Commercial Crew Program is a turning point for America‚Äôs future in space exploration that lays the groundwork for future missions to the [Moon](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/moon/), [Mars](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/), [and beyond](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/).""

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink 7 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/hitura-nobad, your host for this mission.

#  Mission Overview

The eight Starlink launch overall and the seventh operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy all sixty satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession) rates to separate themselves into three planes. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.

Elon Musk at Astro2020,1588013618," This post is a compilation of Elon Musk and SpaceX presentation for Astro2020 regarding Starlink and Starship

[Jeff Foust on Twitter:](https://twitter.com/jeff_foust/status/1254818901944344576?s=20)

""Elon  Musk is giving a presentation at a public meeting of an Astro2020  astrophysics decadal survey cmte meeting on efforts to mitigate  brightness of Starlink satellites. First ‚ÄúVisorSat‚Äù satellites, with  sunshade to block reflections off antennas, planned to be on next  launch. ""

""Musk also says that  SpaceX is implementing an ‚Äúorientation roll‚Äù on those satellites whose  orbits are being raised to reduce reflections off solar panels.""

""Musk  estimates the existing Starlink satellites, including those without any  brightness mitigations, will be deorbited in 3-4 years, in part because  they‚Äôll be rendered obsolete by v2 satellites with  ‚Äúfar greater  throughput.‚Äù""

""Musk says darkening the satellites is ‚Äúquite simple, actually‚Äù and that ‚Äúwe‚Äôll feel a bit silly in hindsight.‚Äù""

""Musk:  think 550 km altitude is the right approach for LEO broadband  constellations, but don‚Äôt know if there will be a lot of other systems.  ‚ÄúThe big challenge is not going bankrupt.‚Äù ""

""Musk  says he‚Äôs ‚Äúpretty interested‚Äù to talk with astronomy community on ways  to launch or even build a large space telescope, ‚Äúmaybe a planet imager  or something like this.‚Äù""

""Musk  briefly mentions Starship launch system, says that ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see regular  flights, I think, within a couple years.‚Äù Notes that it could play a  role in launching space based telescopes. ""

[I  will say that this presentation by @elonmusk for #Astro2020 includes  the most detailed view of the Starlink satellites I have yet seen. He's  reiterating the point about the goal of Starlink to not yield an impact  to science.](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254818492177514508?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  : We're interested in replacing the earliest Starlink sats we launched  as the tech progresses. We expect the 1st generation sats to be replaced  on a timescale of 3-4 years.

[As  an aside, @elonmusk mentioned the large diameter of the Starship faring  and its ability to launch ""quite a big thing"" in it, referring to a  question about using SpaceX hardware to launch telescopes and similar  missions into space. #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254822814592335876?s=20)

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink 6 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/Shahar603, your host for this mission.

#  Mission Overview

The seventh Starlink launch overall and the sixth operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy all sixty satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession) rates to separate themselves into three planes. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.

"Elon Tweetstorm (Re: Rocket Reuse, Reliability, Rocketlab, Starship)",1587037384,"[Elon gets into it with Eric Berger and twitterverse](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1250612062989905921), here's highlights: -

Eric Berger: ""SpaceX is surely saving money on launches, and if the Falcon 9 weren't already insanely cheaper than everyone else, the company could cut prices substantially.""

**Elon:** ""True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they‚Äôd be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying.""

Eric Berger: ""Maybe check Block 5‚Äôs record [on reliability].""

**Elon:** ""Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That‚Äôs the acid test.""

Michael Sheetz: ""How much less?""

**Elon:** ""Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only [American] rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.""

Everyday Astronaut: ""Atlas V is an American rocket (well minus the engines ;)""

**Elon:** ""Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.""

~~[CProphet sidenote: believe Airbus manufacture Atlas V airframe]~~ 

**Elon:** ""Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch""

**Elon:** ""Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It‚Äôs a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!""

Tobi Li: ""What Is the latest SN number for the raptor engine?""

**Elon:** ""SN26""

Sivakumar Kumar: ""What do you think about @RocketLab‚Äôs latest retrieval effort?""

**Elon:** ""Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn‚Äôt scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it‚Äôs probably right move for small LEO vehicle.""

**Elon:** ""I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It‚Äôs very hard. I‚Äôm spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done :)""

Everyday Astronaut: ""It‚Äôs insane how quick SN4 is coming together. It makes sense when you build a factory AROUND your rockets (not vice versa), cool to see mass manufacturing taking an early lead in development vs one off prototyping. I hope when it‚Äôs closer to done I can get a tour from you ;)""

**Elon:** ""Production is by *far* the hard part. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they‚Äôre pretty sweet ‚Ä¶""

Everyday Astronaut: ""It‚Äôd be so cool to do a tour of Hawthorne vs Boca Chica and see the differences in philosophies between early SpaceX vs current. Boca Chica is just a giant playground / test bed, which is cool!""

**Elon:** ""Sure""

Keith Mansfield: ""Everything crossed for SN4. This time!""

**Elon:** ""That‚Äôs for sure! [Smiling face with open mouth and cold sweat]""

Michael Baylor: ""Will SN4 hop to 20 km or just 150 m if the pressure tests and static fire goes well?""

**Elon:** ""SN4 won‚Äôt get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.""

Analysis: Elon sounds stressed, which is understandable. Only a couple of days until SN4 pressure test - and its already made redundant by SN5/6.

#Starlink-6 (STARLINK V1.0-L6)

We are looking for launch thread hosts. If you are interested in hosting please send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fspacex).

## Overview

The seventh Starlink launch overall and the sixth operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy all sixty satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of precession rates to separate themselves into three planes. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.

---
| Liftoff currently scheduled for: | April 16 21:31 UTC (5:31PM local EDT) |
| --- | --- |
| Backup date | TBD, the launch time gets about 20-24 minutes earlier per day. |

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

## About The Recovery

SpaceX is going to conclude the CRS-20 Cargo Dragon mission to the International Space Station on April 7th with the deorbit and recovery of this spacecraft. Dragon will splash down in the Pacific Ocean approximately 815 km southwest of  Los Angeles. The west coast dragon recovery ship NRC Quest will be waiting at the landing zone to pick dragon up and bring it back to the harbour.

Statement from CONAE regarding the postponement of SAOCOM 1B,1585076401,"*SpaceX has provided the following statement from CONAE, translated to English, regarding the postponement of the SAOCOM 1B mission:*

**The launch of the SAOCOM 1B satellite is postponed**
 
The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation and the National Commission for Space Activities (CONAE) announce the decision to postpone the launch of the SAOCOM 1B satellite, originally scheduled for the end of March.
 
This decision has been made considering the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and that could affect the availability of own resources and foreign third-party resources, necessary not only for a safe insertion into orbit, but also for further operation of the satellite.
 
This postponement has been agreed with the company providing the launch service, SpaceX, considering that it is the best decision in these moments of uncertainty and dynamism about the situation that the whole world suffers because of COVID-19.
 
This measure will be supplemented with activities at the launch base that will ensure the conditions for adequate protection of the SAOCOM 1B satellite at the SpaceX facilities.
 
The authorities of this Commission will await the evolution of the conditions that will make possible the resume of the activities related to the launch of the SAOCOM 1B satellite and its subsequent reliable injection into its final orbit according to the original plans.",spacex,johnkphotos,False,/r/spacex/comments/foav19/statement_from_conae_regarding_the_postponement/

## About Starlink

"" SpaceX is leveraging its experience in building rockets and spacecraft to deploy the world's most advanced broadband internet system. With performance that far surpasses that of traditional satellite internet and a global network unbounded by ground infrastructure limitations, Starlink will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable. Each Starlink satellite weights approximately 260 kg and features a compact, flat-panel design that minimizes volume, allowing for a dense launch stack to take full advantage of Falcon 9‚Äôs launch capabilities. With four powerful phased array and two parabolic antennas on each satellite, an enormous amount of throughput can be placed and redirected in a short time, for an order of magnitude lower cost than traditional satellite-based internet. Starlink satellites are on the leading edge of on-orbit debris mitigation, meeting or exceeding all regulatory and industry standards. At end of their life cycle, the satellites will utilize their on-board propulsion system to deorbit over the course of a few months. In the unlikely event their propulsion system becomes inoperable, the satellites will burn up in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere within 1-5 years, significantly less than the hundreds or thousands of years required at higher altitudes. Further, Starlink components are designed for full demisability. Starlink is targeting service in the Northern U.S. and Canada in 2020, rapidly expanding to near global coverage of the populated world by 2021. Additional information on the system can be found at starlink.com. ""

## Core B1048.5

The core utilized in this mission is core 48. This core completed a historic first for SpaceX, which is launching and landing a core for the 5th time. Previously, this core flew on the Iridium-7, SAOCOM-1A, Nusantara Satu, and the 2nd launch of Starlink missions. Unfortunately, during this mission core 48 failed to land. According to Musk, an engine turned off (some speculate an engine went boom, similar to CRS-1). The core had a good ascent until the anomaly, separated stages, deployed fins, and completed what appears to have been a 2 engine entry burn (speculation). Beyond that, it seems it didn't even light for landing, and smashed into the ocean at terminal speed. RIP B1048.

## Fairing

In this mission, the fairings are flight-proven. These 2 halves both previously supported the first launch of Starlink in May of last year, with these halves being fished from the sea by GO Navigator and GO Searcher. This is only the second time SpaceX has utilized previously flown fairings, with high hopes of continuing to recover and reuse other halves. The 2 halves were not caught, but were, however, retrieved from the ocean by Ms. tree and Ms. Chief.

Introducing the Starlink Deployment Update Bot,1580664066,"Hey everyone,

I want to introduce my new Twitter bot to you:

#### [ The Starlink Deployment Update Bot](https://twitter.com/StarlinkUpdates)

### What can it do?
It is posting updated graphs of the Starlink satellite attitude for each launch once a day on twitter.

### How does it work?
#### Part 1: The Scrapper
It uses wget to download https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/supplemental/starlink.txt three times a day, 1 hour after the update is released by SpaceX, and saves it onto my Server.
#### Part 2: Calculator
The next script loads the TLEs and calculates different orbit heights from them.
#### Part 3: Separator
The following script splits the TLEs after the different missions and appends to the archive of previously calculated data points for the specific launch.
#### Part 4: Generator/Plotter
The plotter uses Matplotlib to generated an updated graph from the given data and saves it as png.
#### Part 5: Poster
The last script uploads the png to twitter and posts the thread once a day.

### Future Expansions
- Possibility to highlight specific sats
- Loading additional data from the r/SpaceX API
- Plotting other interesting values than just orbital height

### Thanks
- u/thevehicledestroyer for helping to debug my TLE generation code making it more accurate
- Dr. T.S. Kelso for providing me the exact times when SpaceX publishes new TLEs",spacex,hitura-nobad,False,/r/spacex/comments/exrmyu/introducing_the_starlink_deployment_update_bot/

SpaceX will launch a Crew Dragon capsule from LC-39A, Kennedy Space Center on a fully fueled Falcon 9 rocket and then trigger the launch escape system during the period of maximum dynamic pressure. The abort sequence terminates launcher thrust, separates Dragon and trunk from the second stage, and ignites the eight SuperDraco engines which pull the capsule away from the launch vehicle. Following shutdown of the SuperDracos Dragon coasts to apogee, separates from the trunk, and lands in the Atlantic Ocean under parachutes. Crew Dragon will be recovered by GO Searcher after splashdown approximately 30 km from the launch site. This flight does not go to orbit.

Falcon 9 core 1046.4 flies in expendable configuration, without legs, grid fins, or TEA-TEB engine ignition fluid. Since the abort sequence will be initiated before staging, the second stage has not been equipped with an Mvac engine or the associated hardware, but is expected to be fueled. Falcon 9 will likely break apart due to aerodynamic loads immediately following Crew Dragon's escape.

The abort test occurs approximately 80-100 seconds into flight. Breakup of Falcon 9 is expected within seconds thereafter. Splashdown of the capsule will occur within a few minutes following abort.

##Mission-Specific FAQ

###Will the flight termination system be used?

From the [Environmental Assessment](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/environmental/nepa_docs/review/launch/media/Final_EA_and_FONSI_for_SpaceX_In-flight_Dragon_Abort_508_A.pdf 'FAA.gov (PDF)') it does not appear that the autonomous flight termination system will be used. The abort sequence will be triggered by a ""simulated loss of thrust"" (rather than a disintegrating rocket). The booster is expected to become uncontrollable after Dragon separation and break apart from the intense aerodynamic forces within seconds. A conflagration is possible, but not certain.

###Is there a chance the booster will land, and what is the downrange launch hazard area for?

The Environmental Assessment explicitly states that no landing attempt (or landing gear) will be a part of this mission. Although environmental assessments often contain outdated information, this is also supported by the lack of the usual booster recovery communications permit. The downrange [launch hazard area](https://twitter.com/raul74cz/status/1212197735820083200 'Twitter, @Raul74Cz') appears to represent the improbable scenario in which the abort system fails to terminate thrust. Falcon 9 or its post reentry debris would fall in this hazard area.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if changes or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

JCSAT-18 is a mobile broadband communications payload built for Sky Perfect JSAT Corporation of Japan and will service Asia Pacific. Kacific1 is a high throughput broadband internet payload built for Kacific Broadband Satellites and will service certain high demand areas of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Both payloads share a single chassis.

SpaceX will launch the Boeing built dual payload satellite to geostationary transfer orbit from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral AFS on a Falcon 9, and the first-stage booster is expected to land downrange on the OCISLY droneship.

This is SpaceX's **13th** mission of 2019, its **6th** commercial flight of the year and the **77th** Falcon 9 launch overall. It will re-use the FT Block 5 booster flown on NASA CRS-17 and CRS-18.

## Mission-Specific FAQ

### Why is this mission landing on the droneship downrange, rather than back at Cape Canaveral?

Boosting satellites into geostationary transfer orbit takes a lot more energy/delta-V (i.e. propellant) than just into low earth orbit, given the apogee of the former is 35 786 km as opposed to 200-2000 km for the latter. This requires the Falcon 9 second stage to perform a substantial extra to inject the satellite into this orbit from LEO, which requires that sufficient propellant be left over from insertion into the initial LEO parking orbit. This in turn requires the first stage to do more of the work accelerating the second stage to orbital velocity, meaning that it in turn is both traveling at a higher speed at separation and is further downrange from the Cape, while having less propellant remaining.

Therefore, with less propellant available and more required to boost back, landing on the droneship allows the booster to efficiently use its remaining propellant margin to perform an entry burn, reducing re-entry heating, and leaving it enough margin for the landing burn. 


### How come this mission is landing if its heavier than the 5500 kg reusable GTO limit?

The payload will be delivered into a subsynchronous GTO, with an apogee lower than the standard 35 786 km, which naturally takes less propellant from the second stage to raise its orbit to. Therefore, the second stage can in turn do more of the work injecting into a parking orbit, allowing the first stage enough propellant margin to land. While this results in a somewhat longer time for the satellite to come into service, and requires a larger propellant tank for its kick motor, the customer evidently decided the substantially cheaper launch cost vs. an expendable or Falcon Heavy launch was worth these relatively modest downsides. This has been done on several prior missions, such as Telstar 18V and 19V.

## Watching the Launch

Check out the [Watching a Launch page](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/faq/watching) on this sub's FAQ, which gives a summary of every viewing site and answers many more common questions, as well as [Ben Cooper's launch viewing guide](http://www.launchphotography.com/Delta_4_Atlas_5_Falcon_9_Launch_Viewing.html), [Launch Rats](https://launchrats.com/), and the [Space Coast Launch Ambassadors](https://scla.space) which have interactive maps, photos and detailed information about each site.


### I want the best view of the launch. Where should I go?

The KSCVC LC-39 gantry is indisputably the best option (cost aside) and an incredible experience, but is now sold out. The KSCVC Saturn V Center is second best, and is first come, first serve so get there early (before 9 am recommended)! Playalinda beach is the closest low-cost option by a considerable margin, though the view of the pad is obstructed by dunes and scrub, while Titusville and Port Canaveral are further but free/low cost. There are a number of additional options further away; check out the information on our [Watching a Launch FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/faq/watching) (courtesy Julia Bergeron and the SLCA) for more.


### I'd like the closest possible view of this launch's booster landing. What's my best option?

Unfortunately, since the landing will be far downrange, you'll be lucky to even catch a glimpse of the entry burn (which is possible, though far from guaranteed, anywhere you have a clear shot to the eastern horizon). Other than that, this isn't possible, sorry, so you should optimize for launch accordingly.

Starship Development Thread #5,1567275803,"## Overview[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ECHxL2oXoAAUTMX.jpg)

SpaceX teams are building two [Starship](/r/spacex/wiki/vehicles#wiki_starship) prototypes to follow on from the now retired Starhopper. The vehicles are being constructed at their Starship Assembly Site in Texas, and at their facilities in Cocoa, Florida. The teams at the two locations [are competing](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1128448308970541056) to build the first functional prototype, but are also [required to share with each other](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1128449289498218496) insights learned along the way. These vehicles will have [aerodynamic control surfaces](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1163889282936967168) and [at least three engines](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1131429223258677248) each. Between the two vehicles, both [suborbital and orbital flights](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1166860032052539392) are expected. Ring sections believed to be for a Super Heavy booster prototype are being built in Cocoa.

A planned, dedicated [Starship launch platform at LC-39A](https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=48720.0), may serve either or both of the Starship prototypes. Suborbital launches might also occur from the Starship Launch Site in Boca Chica. Flight tests could begin late 2019.

Starship, and its test vehicles, are powered by SpaceX's Raptor, a full flow staged combustion cycle  methane/oxygen rocket engine. Sub-scale Raptor test firing began in 2016, and full-scale test firing began early 2019 at McGregor, Texas, where it is ongoing. Eventually, Starship will have [three sea level Raptors and three vacuum Raptors](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1131433322276483072). Super Heavy will initially use around [20 Raptors](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1131625229367693312), and is [expected to have 35](https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1152853620682924032) to 37 in the final design.

Our [last](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/ak4ugx/january_2019_modpost_our_moderation_new_mods_new/) metathread took quite a while to writeup and it was too long for most people to read so this time we're going to try a little bit different format.

Basically, we're leaving the top as a stub and writing up a handful of topics as top level comments, and invite you to reply to those comments. And of course, anyone can write their own top level comments, bringing up their own comments/topics, the mod team is just getting the ball rolling with a few topics.

As usual, you can ask or say anything in here freely. We've so far never had to remove a comment from a meta thread (only bigotry and spam is off limits)

RADARSAT Constellation Launch Campaign Thread,1559200062,"### **RADARSAT Constellation Launch Campaign Thread**

RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) is a three satellite Earth observation constellation developed by MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates for the Canadian Space Agency. The primary RCM instrument is a 9.45 m^(2) C-band synthetic aperture radar antenna (one each). They will also carry Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers. The three identical spacecraft will operate in one plane, separated from each other by 120 degrees, improving accuracy, flexibility, and revisit time over their larger standalone precursor, RADARSAT 2. The main applications of RCM will be:

* Maritime surveillance (ice, surface wind, oil pollution, and ship monitoring)
* Disaster management (mitigation, warning, response, and recovery)
* Ecosystem monitoring (agriculture, wetlands, forestry, and coastal change monitoring)

This will be SpaceX's seventh mission of 2019 and its second from Vandenberg. The satellites will be carried to space side-by-side on a dispenser custom built for this mission by RUAG Space for ""simultaneous"" release.

We may keep this self-post occasionally updated with links and relevant news articles, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather, and more as we progress towards launch. Sometime after the static fire is complete, the launch thread will be posted.

[](/# MC // section mission)
# Primary Mission: Deployment of payload into correct orbit

This will be the first of many Starlink launches launching a total of 60 generation 1 Starlink satellites. Each satellite weights 227kg adding up to a total payload mass of 13620kg. The deployment of the satellites will start about one hour after launch in a 440km high low earth orbit. The satellites will use their own onboard krypton fueled ion engines to raise their orbit to the planned 550km operating altitude. 

The Starlink satellites will enable high bandwidth low latency connection everywhere around the globe. According to tweets of Musk, limited service will be able to start after 7 Starlink launches, moderate after 12.

[](/# MC // section landing)
# Secondary Mission: Landing Attempt

The first stage will try to perform a landing after lifting the second stage together with the payload to about 70 to 90 km. Due to the very high payload mass, the stage will not have enough propellant left on board, so will instead land about 610km offshore on Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY), SpaceX east coast Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS). Tug boat Hollywood and support-ship Go Quest are a safe distance from the landing zone and will return the booster to Port Canaveral after the Landing. Go Navigator and Crew Dragon recovery vessel Go Searcher are about 120km further offshore and will try to recover both payload fairing halves after they parachute back from space and softly touch down on the ocean surface. They two will return to Port Canaveral after the mission.

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX CRS-17 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I miss *one* CRS launch and the booster goes in the drink. My bad!

I am u/fourmica and I will be your host for CRS-17, the latest SpaceX Commercial Resupply Service flight to the ISS. Normally, ISS missions land their booster back at LZ-1, but due to [the Crew Dragon test anomaly](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/04/spacexs-crew-dragon-spacecraft-anomaly-static-fire-testing/) it will instead be [landing on Of Course I Still Love You](https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-falcon-9-booster-landing-change/) stationed approximately 28km downrange from SLC-40 in the Atlantic Ocean.

For those who wish to see the launch in person, please note that Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center are **closed** for this launch. Jetty Park was open this morning; most of the local parks are closed from dusk to dawn. A Titusville resident in the thread suggests checking out the parks on Washington St. if you're looking for a place to watch!

Big thanks as always to u/theZCuber for this killer Mission Control app for the thread!

# Primary Mission: Delivery of CRS-17 to the International Space Station, return of Dragon to Earth

Delivering the payload for the customer is always the primary mission! SpaceX's contract with NASA has them delivering supplies, experiments, and equipment to the ISS. After launch, Dragon will slowly raise its orbit, ""hover"" alongside the ISS in the safe zone, and gently approach to be captured by the station's remote manipulator system (a fancy way of saying ""robotic arm"") to be berthed to the ISS. Afterward, Dragon will be loaded with cargo to be returned to Earth, and sent to splash down in the Pacific Ocean. Dragon remains the only means by which significant cargo may be returned from the ISS to the Earth.

# Secondary Mission: Booster landing

SpaceX will attempt to recover the booster on OCISLY. Dragon does not use a normal payload fairing, so there will be no fairing recovery.

We may keep this self-post occasionally updated with links and relevant news articles, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Sometime after the static fire is complete, the launch thread will be posted.

[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DwmagBZX4AEbUN-.jpg:large)
The Starship Hopper is a prototype of SpaceX next generation rocket Superheavy &amp; Starship. It is being built at their private launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. It is made out of stainless steel and it will be powered by 3 Raptor engines.
## Modnote
We decided to close the experimental reddit live thread, because there weren't many community volunteers to keep it updated. We have chosen to try it again using our good old campaign threads.
We will add important news to the update section.
## Updates

+ [Starship Cam by Spadre.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7zia2HqOOc)

## Rules
We may keep this self-post occasionally updated with links and relevant news articles, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the progress of the test Campaign. **Campaign threads are not launch threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

"January 2019 Modpost: Our Moderation, New Mods, New Rules and more!",1548535458,"Hey everyone! 

It‚Äôs been quite a while since our [last modpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/83wwju), which came out just after the first Falcon Heavy first launch. We‚Äôve come up with a few things we‚Äôd like to discuss in order to get your feedback. The sub‚Äôs growth has been massive over the past year (100k more users since our last modpost), and it‚Äôs put a heavy strain on our moderation methods. These processes worked fairly well when the community was a bit smaller, a bit more tightly knit and mutually respectful, perhaps a bit more niche. We‚Äôve rapidly become very mainstream, whether we like it or not, but we‚Äôre still trying as hard as we can to sustain the community spirit and technical expertise that made this place great to begin with. Balancing the twin themes of growth and depth has caused a _lot_ of conflicts of interest, so let‚Äôs have an open and honest conversation about how best to proceed as an integrated community.

We‚Äôll address the topics we feel to be most important in the main body of this post. If there‚Äôs anything we‚Äôve missed, we‚Äôre sure you‚Äôll let us know about it in the comments. :) 

# 0. Feedback

As always, please use this post as a platform to voice your woes and worries about the sub and about our moderation. Feel free also to say nice things about us :) In either case, please keep it polite and constructive.

We hope to increase the frequency of these modposts to get your feedback more often and have smaller modposts instead of big walls of text like this to get more constant feedback instead of yearly deltas of feedback.

To improve on this side, we‚Äôve also decided to change our r/SpaceX Discusses Thread rules to allow meta comments (previously it wasn‚Äôt allowed, even if basically never applied that rule). 

# 1. Post Approval Times

In the hopes that this might set the tone for a civil modpost from all sides, we‚Äôd like to begin with a slice of humble pie: our approval times over the past few months have been total crap. There. We said it. 

Now more importantly, what are we going to do about it? Let‚Äôs first give an overview of the system that we‚Äôve been using. How did we get here?:

Someone submits a new post on r/SpaceX
This gets automatically posted to our private moderation Slack channel where we are all notified to vote on it and discuss if necessary
We approve a post if (#positive votes - #negative votes) &gt;= 2 and vice versa for removal (In the past it used to be 3). However there are a lot of exceptions, for example we usually don‚Äôt need votes for official content (from SpaceX or Elon) or for spam and single questions that get redirected to the r/SpaceX Discusses Thread.
If we‚Äôre on the fence about a post or there aren‚Äôt enough mods around to vote (e.g on Days when most of the mods are unavailable), we usually auto-approve a post if it‚Äôs been in the queue for more than 12-18 hours, and we try to never exceed 24 hours

This system was introduced to combat the tirade of ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they just have a pole with some nets and pulleys on the barge so that if the rocket is falling over they could, like, catch it with magnets under the ship and oh yeah also magnets on the legs and um some balloons there too maybe‚Äù posts. This system was a _godsend_ when it was introduced. It still is, in this context. It catches a lot of the junk, spam, even literal porn that had begun to push some of our most active and valuable contributors away from the Reddit platform _entirely_.

So with this in mind we‚Äôd like to make one thing clear: we‚Äôre _never_ going to revert back the the auto-approval system on this subreddit. We‚Äôve already been there and it just doesn‚Äôt work. We want to keep the Signal to Noise Ratio as high as possible, and to achieve that we have to keep this system. Many users suggest ‚Äúleaving‚Äù the moderation to the users by only using upvotes and downvotes, but while that may work in small communities (and we see that it works in the Lounge) it never works in large subreddits, and that‚Äôs the reason every large subreddit employs active moderation.

Here‚Äôs the problem, though: potentially interesting submissions that maybe should, maybe shouldn‚Äôt be approved get lost under the flood of junk and spam along with a whole bunch of hostility, memes, batshit nonsense, simple questions, interesting spaceflight news that has nothing to do with SpaceX, beautiful art, inspirational parenting, spectacular fan creations, the list goes on. This noise is greatly amplified whenever something from r/SpaceX hits the front page‚Ä¶ especially the batshit hostility. You should have seen our modqueue that time when Elon called someone a pedo.

Of course we are continually working on improving our times. We‚Äôve recently recruited two new mods (more on this down the post) and implemented a new slack system that helps prioritize content. We‚Äôre hoping this small change will improve our workflow and significantly raise the signal to noise ratio of our vote pool. The switch in backend approval method occurred effective Jan 1 and we‚Äôve been somewhat encouraged by the results so far, but we also know it‚Äôs not enough. It almost immediately failed with the flood of Starship updates, hence the live thread experiment. We‚Äôre _extremely_ interested in your own ideas about how to improve our response time without bloating the mod staff or flooding the front page.

We‚Äôd like to point out that at one point, every single comment here required manual approval from the moderation team. _And it worked._ For a while... That‚Äôs a part of what made this community what it is today, regardless of how crazy it seems now. This will not be the first time that subscriber growth has forced us to radically alter our moderation methods.



# 2. r/SpaceX &amp; r/SpaceXLounge

We are very acutely aware that there exists a population of users who are chronically unhappy about the way this subreddit is run. This is what prompted [the creation of r/SpaceXLounge](link creation post here). The moderators of both communities strongly agree that the two should coexist as complementary, companion subreddits. The two do not compete and should not be in competition against each other. We are also aware that there is another, hopefully smaller population of users who believe that the lounge is better, it should be the ‚Äòprimary‚Äô subreddit, and the moderators here are actually Wolfensteinish robotic Hitler and/or Stalin scumbags who willingly suppress the will of their readers with iron chaingun fists. We hear you. Once again, we‚Äôve inadvertently pushed away some of our most active and valuable contributors. We have no idea how to deal with this situation and would genuinely appreciate your input on the matter, from both sides of the aisle.

We don‚Äôt know what the solution is, but we do know that animosity is unacceptable and we want to fix it. Ignoring hate is not a viable solution because vitriol is loud and annoying and will dominate the discussion if unchecked.


# 3. New (sort of) Mods! Welcome to the team u/marc020202, u/Nsooo and u/hitura-nobad!
To further improve our approval times and reduce the workload of us ‚Äúold‚Äù mods, we decided to employ into the mod team a new mod three months ago and two other well known users a few days ago. They‚Äôll introduce themselves in the comments, everybody say hi!


# 4. Quality Self-Posts

Quality self-posts might be defined as submissions in which the OP has created a well-thought out, well-referenced and comprehensive selfpost to present their idea to the community for critical analysis. These posts used to be the bread and butter of this subreddit! 

We‚Äôve recently had some _epic_ write-ups, like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/a9y9r0) by u/asaz989 about Starship Reentry and [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/ab840h) about Starship‚Äôs wings by u/MaximilianCrichton       
They don‚Äôt always have to be physics- or engineering-based. A good example of a non-technical post is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/7vqje4) by u/CProphet on the day of the Falcon Heavy launch. Unfortunately we had to lock that one because everybody was still freaking out and nobody actually wanted to have that discussion :(       
You might see a pattern that they tend to appear when something particularly inspirational is happening in real life.

But please, please, please let‚Äôs have more of these, even in the downtime!

We all love to speculate and wonder about the future, but we have to make the distinction between _baseless_ speculation and _informed_ speculation. The former is useless and the latter educates us and excites us. 
So while we heavily desire more of these posts, we will continue to enforce a prerequisite of prior research and references to ensure quality.

# 5. Reddit Redesign, Toolbox, Modmail

One of the factors that have made our work harder lately has been the degradation of the tools at our disposal for moderation.
New Modmail has been less than optimal for two years now. We only recently got the ability to search our modmail history.
The Reddit redesign has doubled the amount of work needed for the upkeep of the subs exterior simply by existing (and not replacing the old design at once).
As moderators we can‚Äôt just opt out of the redesign because we need to maintain both. The tools we use, like the moderator toolbox, simply don‚Äôt work consistently in the new environment.

This part is not supposed to be just whining about the situation. We‚Äôd like to ask for your support in different areas to improve our tools and sub.
We‚Äôre already receiving great service by u/Captain_Hadock and u/Straumli_Blight with mission patches and sprite sheets for our old design.

In addition we‚Äôre looking at our tools in general. Many actions we need to do regularly are - at the moment - not possible to do on mobile. That greatly reduces our ability to perform even basic mod action.

On another good note, the great work of u/theZcuber provided us with r/SpaceX Mission Control, a fantastic tool used by us and the other Launch Thread Hosts that makes that job much more easier and enjoyable. A big thank you for that too. We can‚Äôt wait for the new Enceladus software!


# 6. Rule changes and clarifications
First off, we‚Äôre adding ‚ÄúBad URL‚Äù as a removal reason to Rule 5. 
‚Äú*Ensure that your URL is clean:* Make sure your submitted link goes directly to the beginning of the article, without any junk like ad trackers. Nothing superfluous, and please don‚Äôt link directly to the comments after an article or its mobile version. For example, if you see a ‚Äò?‚Äô in your URL try getting rid of that and everything after it. If the link still works, submit that version instead.‚Äù
This will also be added as a bullet point to Rule 5.


We are also adding a new rule, Rule 7, to specifically address Fan art. Here is the new rule:

7. Posts should not consist solely of Fan Art
This subreddit is focused more on the technical side of SpaceX than the artistic side. Please post your Fan Art work in the r/SpaceXLounge if it consists of:

* Paintings
* Handmade drawings
* Novels
* Replicas
* Animations 

This rule doesn‚Äôt apply to technical content such as launch simulations or to content whose quality is deemed professional and is not purely artistic. Take a look at the [community content](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/search?q=flair:%22Community+Content%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) posted in the past to get an idea about what should and what shouldn‚Äôt be posted. Feel free to contact us via modmail if you want to ask whether you should post your work on r/SpaceX or on r/SpaceXLounge.

We want to examine every one of our rules and removal reasons with the community to figure out what makes sense and what doesn‚Äôt. We get a lot of hate for calling people‚Äôs stuff ‚Äúlow effort‚Äù or not ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù but can‚Äôt think of reasonable alternatives. (not salience!) There is a top level comment below for discussion of each rule and its removal reasons. Please help us fix them!


# 7. Miscellaneous
## i) Transparency

[Here is a screenshot of our mod actions from the end of last year.](https://i.imgur.com/0ofQqga.png) These actions were performed in a period between October and December. We can only provide you this sample because unfortunately we can‚Äôt get the older data as we didn‚Äôt save it and the toolbox can‚Äôt pull it from reddit. We are sorry about that. Keep in mind that there is a ton of stuff that happens that doesn‚Äôt get counted as a mod action, like handling e-mails, dealing with security threats, talking to the reddit admins, working on long modmail replies, doing meta thread writeups, organizing live threads, maintaining code base, etc.etc. Mod actions alone are only a portion of the work mods are putting in, but it is the most easily quantifiable.

If there is another transparency question you‚Äôd like to ask and we‚Äôre able to answer, we‚Äôd be happy to help.


## ii) r/SpaceX Chat Room

As everyone probably already knows, the chat feature was added on Reddit months ago. For those who don‚Äôt know about it, it can either be used for Direct messages or for Chat Rooms. As of now, we, as a subreddit, don‚Äôt have an official chat room, but since it has been some time since it was introduced and it hasn‚Äôt been removed by now, we want to ask you what do you think about having a General Room or maybe a Launch Room. Our fear is that it could be redundant as we already have the r/SpaceX Discusses Thread and the Launch Threads and we don‚Äôt want to fragment the discussion, but the chat would be something always in ‚Äúparty‚Äù mode for more casual discussions.

We may keep this self-post occasionally updated with links and relevant news articles, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Sometime after the static fire is complete, the launch thread will be posted.
**Campaign threads are not launch threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

r/SpaceX Best of 2018 Results,1547459860,"#r/SpaceX Best of 2018 Results


So, here we are, announcing the winners of the r/SpaceX Best of 2018 contest.

First of all, you will see that some of the awards were redistributed since some categories didn't get enough nominations. What we decided to do was to provide 2 extra gold for the Best Picture Category, 1 Extra Gold for the Best Self Post Category and to provide 1 Extra Gold to the Best Launch Thread (host) category by also automatically nominating all the hosts that were not nominated, since we think that they deserve something for the service they provided to the subreddit.

This is the new Award distribution:

Category | Reddit Platinum | Reddit Gold
---|---|---
Best Picture | 2 | 6
Best Self Post | 2 | 5
Best Launch Thread (host) | 2 | 5
Best Post Overall | 2 | 1
Participation Award | 0 | 5
Mod Pick | 2 | 2

The total amount of coins spent remains 30000. At the end of the post, there is a section dedicated the the Participation Award and to the Mod Picks. But first, here are the winners of the r/SpaceX Best of 2018!

---

**Best Launch**: This was well expected - and the reason for the next category - but it just shows the impact it had.  
  
\# | Contender
---|---
1 | Falcon Heavy
2 | SSO-A

---

**Best Falcon 9 Launch**: Interesting results. The first Block 5 launch barely wins over the largest rideshare ever performed on a US Launch Vehicle, while the spectacular landing failure of B1050 takes the third place. The first Vandenberg RTLS launch and the mysterious Zuma launch are great runners up.

\# | Contender
---|---
1 | Bangabandhu-1
2 | SSO-A
3 | CRS 16
4 | SAOCOM 1A
5 | Zuma
6 | Telstar 19V

---

**Best Event**: Well, what can I say here? The NASA investigation was certainly talked about a lot with the image of Elon smoking a joint getting broad media coverage. 

\# | Contender
---|---
1 | Elon smoking weed and the resulting NASA investigation of the culture at Boeing and SpaceX.
2 | Commercial Crew astronauts reveal
3 | Dear moon Announcement 
4 | 2018 BFR Architecture Update
5 | Elon's announcement of Starship change to Stainless Steel

---

**Best News:** Great variety in this category which sees Starship as the most rivetting bit of news source with the Falcon Heavy coming in second.

\# | Contender
---|---
1 | Starship ready for hopper tests so soon
2 | Commercial companies like ViaSat and Ovzon ordering Falcon Heavy with direct GEO insertion
3 | Official Launch date announcement for Falcon Heavy launch
4 | Starship test flight scheduled for March
5 | Falcon Heavy going vertical for the first time at pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center.
6 | The change to 7 sea-level engines on BFS (Starship)
7 | Switch from Carbon to Stainless Steel of the Starship / Superheavy
8 | The $130 million contract from the Air Force to launch AFSPC-52 on Falcon Heavy
9 | Announcement of the Dear Moon Mission

**Mod Picks**: We have a lot of great community members that help us maintain this subreddit in a great shape, in many different ways.

We choose (In order, 2 Reddit Platinum and 2 Reddit Gold) :  
/u/theZcuber for making the great r/SpaceX Mission Control app that makes hosting a Launch Thread much much easier (and cool).  
/u/Captain_Hadock for always providing us the updated sprite sheets (and also the patches, along many others, thank you to everyone else too!) that we use on the old reddit to have the mission patches show up near each post. Saves us a lot of time!  
/u/michaelza199 for updating our wiki so many times and distinguishing himself among the many others who kept updated our Wiki. A big big thank you to everyone involved!  
/u/jclishman for making the great SpaceX Monthly Recap videos. They are awesome! 

---

**Participation Award**: We got only 11 participants, which is a surprising low number. But this means that almost half of you will get reddit gold!

To draw the winners we used random.org, in particular the Random Integer Set Generator, with these settings:

&gt; Generate **1** set(s) with **5** unique random integer(s) in each.
&gt; 
&gt; Each integer should have a value between **1** and **11** (both inclusive; limits ¬±1,000,000,000).*

This was the result: https://i.imgur.com/bpVXcmT.png

We know that this is not completely transparent and we could have cheated since you can't verify this draw, but the Third-Party Draw Service requires a payment so you will have to trust us on this one. To those that didn't win, hopefully you can try again next year!

This is the participants pool along with the extracted winners:

We will wait a few days to provide the awards in case you find any error in what we did and also in case any winner would like to decline the award and gift it someone else. In this case contact us as soon as possible. We also have a pdf copy of the original r/SpaceX Best of 2018 Thread just in case, and it can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lQtqZRHVR-Y0d-dD5e-sdPQ1BPM0tCpg/view?usp=sharing).
This is it for the last year r/SpaceX Best of. Hopefully we'll be able to repeat this format again this year, and if you have any feedback on how to improve it, feel free to tell us in the comments.

Last but not least we want to let you know that we are preparing a big modpost and it will come soon, so don't miss that.

r/SpaceX Best of 2018,1545499045,"You may have seen it happening on other subreddits, and this year it's coming to r/SpaceX as well!

2018 is coming to an end, and with SpaceX set to complete it's last launch of the year soon^TM (This thread was supposed to come after GPS III-2, but you know what happened) it's time to wrap it up and celebrate that best of 2018!  
As part of reddit's r/bestof2018 event, we have got **30,000 Coins** to give away to our subs. How to get them? It's fairly easy: some will go to winners of a particular category, while some will go to the community even just by participating in the voting!

So, here are the categories:

- **Best Launch**: What was the best launch of the year? (Come on, we know already the winner)
- **Best Falcon 9 Launch**: What Launch was, in your opinion the most impressive?
- **Best Event**: This year there were many non-launch events, ranging from the Dear Moon announcement to the reveal of the Commercial Crew Astronauts. Which one was your favorite? 
- **Best News**: r/SpaceX is well known for providing the latest of SpaceX. Which news piece surprised you the most?
- **Best Picture**: We have many talented photographers that post their jaw dropping pictures on r/SpaceX. What picture did impress you the most? The photographers will earn reddit platinum and gold based on your votes!
- **Best Self Post**: Which, in your opinion, was the best self created post (non link) this year? The post creators will earn reddit platinum and gold based on your votes!
- **Best Launch Thread (host)**: Our community is amazing! Some of you even hosted some of the r/SpaceX launch threads! You can find the links to the past launch threads [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/launches). Which thread did you enjoy the most? The hosts will earn reddit platinum and gold based on your votes (No, Elongated won't get it)!
- **Best Post overall**: And for the final category, vote for the absolute best post, the one you were excited to visit or you couldn't believe what you found in it. Everything counts! The post creators will earn reddit platinum and gold based on your votes!

You might ask, **how do I vote?** It's easy: head down to the comments section. There you will find a ""green"" comment made by ElongatedMuskrat, our loyal bot, for each one of the categories. The comments section will be set to contest mode for evening the distribution of votes.  
To vote, **write a comment** with the best of the category, but first **check the other replies!** If someone else already nominated the same of yours, don't comment, **just upvote** the already existing comment! In case of duplicates, only the comment with the most upvotes will be counted and the others will not. 
In case you want to nominate yourself, that is allowed, but any attempt to manipulate the votes (Using bots, for example) is forbidden. 
On **January 10^th, 2019** at 23:59 UTC we will lock this thread, and the votes will be counted. In the rare case of a tie, the post that itself has more upvotes will win. Multiple wins are allowed, so if a user will win in more than a single category, the corresponding amount of awards will be given. The results will be announced shortly after and the awards distributed properly.  

The Gold and platinum will be given according to this table:

Category | Reddit Platinum | Reddit Gold
---|---|---
Best Picture | 2 | 4
Best Self Post | 2 | 4
Best Launch Thread | 2 | 4
Best Post Overall | 2 | 4
Participation Award | 0 | 5
Mod Pick | 2 | 3

As you can see, there are two more ways to get Reddit Gold or Platinum. The first is luck: in the comments section there is an extra category, the **Comments / Feedback Category** (Use this section for comments, any comment outside the replies of the categories comments will be removed!). By adding a comment under this section, you will partecipate in the draw. After Januray 10^th 2019 we will randomly pick the **5** users who will receive **Reddit Gold**.  
We will also give 2 Reddit Platinum and 3 Reddit Gold to Users that while not being mods contributed to making this community awesome. That ranges from keeping the wiki updated to helping us maintain the sub, one way or another.

That said, have fun looking for the Best of 2018!

Good Luck everybody! ",spacex,ElongatedMuskrat,False,/r/spacex/comments/a8mj42/rspacex_best_of_2018/

Iridium NEXT Constellation Mission 7 Launch Campaign Thread,1544799307,"### **Iridium-7 Launch Campaign Thread**


SpaceX's fourteenth mission of 2018 will be the third mission for Iridium this year and seventh overall, leaving only one mission for iridium to launch the last 10 satellites. The Iridium-8 mission is currently scheduled for later this year, in the October timeframe.


Iridium NEXT will replace the world's largest commercial satellite network of low-Earth orbit satellites in what will be one of the
largest ""tech upgrades"" in history. Iridium has partnered with Thales Alenia Space for the manufacturing, assembly and testing of all 81 Iridium NEXT satellites, 75 of which will be launched by SpaceX. Powered by a uniquely sophisticated global constellation of 66 cross-linked Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, the Iridium network provides high-quality voice and data connections over the planet‚Äôs entire surface, including across oceans, airways and polar regions.

GPS III-2 Launch Campaign Thread,1544222820,"### **GPS III-2 Launch Campaign Thread**

This is SpaceX's twenty-first mission of 2018 and the last mission of the year. This launch will utilize a brand new booster that is going to be expended due to mission requirements.

GPS-3 (Global Positioning System) or Navstar-3 (Navigation System using Timing And Ranging) are the first evolution stage of the third generation of the GPS satellites.

The U.S. Air Force announced in May 2008 that a team led by Lockheed Martin has won the competition to build the next-generation Global Positioning System (Navstar) Space System program, known as GPS III.

This program will improve position, navigation, and timing services for the warfighter and civil users worldwide and provide advanced anti-jam capabilities yielding superior system security, accuracy and reliability.

When fully deployed, the GPS III constellation will feature a cross-linked command and control architecture, allowing the entire GPS constellation to be updated simultaneously from a single ground station. Additionally, a new spot beam capability for enhanced military (M-Code) coverage and increased resistance to hostile jamming will be incorporated. These enhancements will contribute to improved accuracy and assured availability for military and civilian users worldwide.

Lockheed Martin's flight-proven A2100 bus will serve as the GPS III spacecraft platform. Unlike the GPS IIF satellite, the GPS III satellite feature an apogee propulsion system. The satellite will feature a LEROS-1C engine as an apogee propulsion system as well as 2 deployable solar arrays to generate power.

ITT, Clifton, N.J. will provide the navigation payload, and General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Gilbert, Ariz., will provide the Network Communications Element (NCE) which includes the UHF Crosslink and Tracking Telemetry &amp; Command (TT&amp;C) subsystems.

We may keep this self-post occasionally updated with links and relevant news articles, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Sometime after the static fire is complete, the launch thread will be posted.
**Campaign threads are not launch threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

We may keep this self-post occasionally updated with links and relevant news articles, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Sometime after the static fire is complete, the launch thread will be posted.
**Campaign threads are not launch threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

We may keep this self-post occasionally updated with links and relevant news articles, but for the most part we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Sometime after the static fire is complete, the launch thread will be posted.

Es'hail 2 Launch Campaign Thread,1539859046,"### **Es'hail 2 Launch Campaign Thread**


SpaceX's eighteenth mission of 2018 will be the launch of Es'hail 2 to a Geostationary Transfer Orbit for Es‚ÄôhailSat, the Qatar Satellite Company.  It will also feature an radio amateur payload.

The new satellite will be positioned at the 26¬∞ East hotspot position for TV broadcasting and significantly adds to the company‚Äôs ability to provide high quality, premium DTH television content across the Middle East and North Africa. It will feature Ku-band and Ka-band transponders to provide TV distribution and government services to strategic stakeholders and commercial customers who value broadcasting and communications independence, interference resilience, quality of service and wide geographical coverage. Es‚Äôhail 2 is expected to be launched at the end of 2016.

Es'hail 2 will also provide the first Amateur Radio geostationary communication capability linking Brazil and India. It will carry two AMSAT P4A (Phase 4A) Amateur Radio transponders. The payload will consist of a 250 kHz linear transponder intended for conventional analogue operations in addition to another transponder which will have an 8 MHz bandwidth. The latter transponder is intended for experimental digital modulation schemes and DVB amateur television. The uplinks will be in the 2.400-2.450 GHz and the downlinks in the 10.450-10.500 GHz amateur satellite service allocations. Both transponders will have broad beam antennas to provide full coverage over about third of the earth‚Äôs surface. The Qatar Amateur Radio Society and Qatar Satellite Company are cooperating on the amateur radio project. AMSAT-DL is providing technical support to the project.

In September 2014, a contract with MELCO was signed to build the satellite based on the DS-2000 bus. In December 2014, a launch contract was signed with SpaceX to launch the satellite on a Falcon-9 v1.2 booster in late 2016, but was delayed to the 3rd quarter of 2017 and then to 2018.

We may keep this self-post occasionally updated with links and relevant news articles, but for the most part we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Sometime after the static fire is complete, the launch thread will be posted.

I want to hear all your guesses on who the passenger is, Ôº£ÔºØÔºÆÔº≥Ôº∞Ôº©Ôº≤Ôº°Ôº£Ôºπ theories, knife fights about what month/year/decade/century it will happen, ideas about how the back wings flap for extra thrust (ok, maybe that is one step too far). But lets have some fun and see who gets bragging rights once the facts get laid out!

Prior to the livestream we have only a few hints to go on:

- üóæ‚ìô‚Ñó
- This lovely [cg image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DnA7hZgU8AAxfxC.jpg:orig) of the vehicle
- [Confirmation the wings move and also act as legs](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/9gfns6/elon_musk_bfr_design_has_been_changed_so_the/)

SAOCOM 1A Launch Campaign Thread,1536964692,"### **SAOCOM 1A Launch Campaign Thread**


SpaceX's seventeenth mission of 2018 will be the launch of SAOCOM 1A to a Low Earth Polar Orbit for Argentine Space Agency CONAE. This will be the first launch of the Saocom Earth observation satellite constellation. The second launch of Saocom 1B will happen in 2019. This flight will mark the first RTLS launch out of Vandenberg, with a landing on the concrete pad at SLC-4W, very close to the launch pad.

The mission is headed by CONAE. INVAP is the prime contractor for the design and construction of the SAOCOM-1 spacecraft and its SAR payload, currently under development. The SAOCOM-1 spacecraft will benefit from the heritage of the SAC-C spacecraft platform.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR-L), an L-Band instrument featuring standard, high resolution and global coverage operational modes with resolution ranging from 7 m to 100 m, and swath within 50 km to 400 km. It features a dedicated high capacity Solid State Recorder (50 to 100 Gbits) for image storage, and a high bit rate downlink system (two X-band channels at 150 Mbits/s each).

The SAOCOMsystem will operate jointly with the Italian COSMO-SkyMed constellation in X-band to provide frequent information relevant for emergency management. This approach of a two SAOCom and a four COSMO-SkyMed spacecraft configuration offers an effective means of a twice-daily coverage capability. By joining forces, both agencies will be able to generate SAR products in X-band and in L-band for their customers.

We may keep this self-post occasionally updated with links and relevant news articles, but for the most part we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Sometime after the static fire is complete, the launch thread will be posted.

Telstar 18V / APStar 5C Launch Campaign Thread,1533657074,"### **Telstar 18V / APStar 5C Launch Campaign Thread**


SpaceX's sixteenth mission of 2018 will be the launch of Telstar 18V / APStar 5C to GTO for Telesat and APStar.

Telesat signed a contract with SSL in December 2015 for the construction of the satellite. It is based on the SSL-1300 bus with an electrical output of approximately 14 kW.

The new satellite will operate from 138¬∞ East and significantly expand Telesat‚Äôs capacity over the Asia Pacific region through a combination of broad regional beams and high throughput spot-beams. Telesat also announced it has entered into an agreement with APT Satellite Company Limited (APSTAR) under which APSTAR will make use of capacity on Telstar-18-VANTAGE to serve its growing base of customers. This agreement extends the long term relationship between APSTAR and Telesat that has existed for more than a decade.

Equipped with C and Ku-band transponders, Telstar 18 VANTAGE will offer superior performance for broadcasters, telecom service providers and enterprise networks on the ground, in the air and at sea. Its broad C-band coverage will extend across the Asia region to Hawaii enabling direct connectivity between any point in Asia and the Americas. Its Ku-band capacity will expand on Telesat‚Äôs coverage of growing satellite service markets in China, Mongolia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Ocean.

Liftoff currently scheduled for: | [August 24^th 2018, 03:33 - 07:33 UTC (August 23^th 2018, 11:33 pm - 03:33 am EDT).](https://spaceflightnow.com/launch-schedule/)

We may keep this self-post occasionally updated with links and relevant news articles, but for the most part we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Sometime after the static fire is complete, the launch thread will be posted.

Merah Putih (Telkom-4) Launch Campaign Thread,1532434906,"### **Merah Putih (Telkom-4) Launch Campaign Thread**


SpaceX's fifteenth mission of 2018 will be the launch of Merah Putih (Formerly Telkom-4) to GTO for Telkom Indonesia .

PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk, the largest telecommunication and network provider in Indonesia, selected Space Systems Loral (SSL) in December 2015 to build the Telkom-4 satellite based on the. The new satellite is to replace its aging Telkom 1 satellite that goes out of commission in 2018.

The satellite will be based on the SSL-1300 platform, which provides the flexibility to support a broad range of applications and technology advances. It will carry 60 C-band transponders. 36 transponders will be used in Indonesia and the rest will be used for the Indian market.

We may keep this self-post occasionally updated with links and relevant news articles, but for the most part we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Sometime after the static fire is complete, the launch thread will be posted.

[](/# MC // section mission)
# Primary Mission: Deployment of payload into correct orbit

The primary mission will be the delivery of the Telstar 19V satellite to a Geostationary Transfer Orbit. A successful separation from the second stage will be needed for mission success. Telstar 19v, or Tele¬¥¬¥star 19 VANTAGE has a dual payload, one in the Ka, and one in the Ku Band. It was built by SSL and is based on the SSL-1300 bus. Its sister satellite Telstar 18 will launch in the following month, also on a Falcon 9. Telstar 19v will be placed at 63¬∞W. Due to its high mass, it is likely that Telstar 19v will be placed into a subsyncroneous transfer orbit. This will also be the heaviest communications satellite ever launched.

After beeing placed, Telstar 19v will use its 4 SPT-100 Ion engines to get into its final Geostationary Orbit.

[](/# MC // section landing)
# Secondary Mission: Landing Attempt

Since this is a Block 5 booster, the recovery of the First Stage is quite important, as SpaceX wants to reuse them at least 10 times. OCISLY will be positioned in the Atlantic Ocean to allow the recovery of B1047. 

Since this mission will launch from the east coast, and the Fairing catcher is positioned on the west coast, there will be no fairing recovery attempt, however the fairing might do some tests with its parafoil, but land in the water. Afterwards the fairing will be collected by Go Pursuit.

The recovery vessels and theire current Status are:

Telstar 19V Launch Campaign Thread,1530707382,"### **Telstar 19V Launch Campaign Thread**


SpaceX's fourteenth mission of 2018 will be the first mission for Telesat this year out of two, the next one happening in a month or two (probably).

Telstar 19 VANTAGE or Telstar 19V is a communications satellite with two high throughput payloads, one in Ku-band and the other in Ka-band.  
Telesat signed a contract with SSL in November 2015 for the construction of the satellite to be based on the SSL-1300 bus.  
Telstar 19 VANTAGE will be the second of a new generation of Telesat satellites optimized to serve the types of bandwidth intensive applications increasingly being used across the satellite industry. Hughes Network Systems LLC (Hughes) has made a significant commitment to utilize the satellite‚Äôs high throughput Ka-band capacity in South America to expand its broadband satellite services. The satellite has additional high throughput Ka-band capacity over Northern Canada, the Caribbean and the North Atlantic Ocean. It will also provide high throughput and conventional Ku-band capacity over Brazil, the Andean region and the North Atlantic Ocean.  
The new satellite will be co-located with Telesat‚Äôs Telstar 14R at 63¬∞ West, a prime orbital slot for coverage of the Americas.

Iridium NEXT Constellation Mission 7 Launch Campaign Thread,1530392290,"### **Iridium-7 Launch Campaign Thread**


SpaceX's thirteenth mission of 2018 will be the third mission for Iridium this year and seventh overall, leaving only one mission for iridium to launch the last 10 satellites. The Iridium-8 mission is currently scheduled for later this year, in the October timeframe.


Iridium NEXT will replace the world's largest commercial satellite network of low-Earth orbit satellites in what will be one of the
largest ""tech upgrades"" in history. Iridium has partnered with Thales Alenia Space for the manufacturing, assembly and testing of all 81 Iridium NEXT satellites, 75 of which will be launched by SpaceX. Powered by a uniquely sophisticated global constellation of 66 cross-linked Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, the Iridium network provides high-quality voice and data connections over the planet‚Äôs entire surface, including across oceans, airways and polar regions.

We may keep this self-post occasionally updated with links and relevant news articles, but for the most part we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Sometime after the static fire is complete, the launch thread will be posted.
**Campaign threads are not launch threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**
